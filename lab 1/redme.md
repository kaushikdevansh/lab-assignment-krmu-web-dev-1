# Devansh Kaushik Portfolio

This is my *first personal portfolio website* made using HTML. I made this to show my projects, skills, and to have a place where people can contact me.  

I’m a *first-year B.Tech student* and I’m just starting to explore web development, Python, CSS, and vibe coding. I built this project while learning and experimenting with coding.  

## Projects
- Personal Portfolio Website  
- Weather app (made using vibe coding)  
- Registration Form

## Skills

## How to Check
1. Download or clone this repository.

This is my first step into web development, and I’m learning as I go!
